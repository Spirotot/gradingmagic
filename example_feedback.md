# Student name will be here

Feedback is here. Paragraph form is fine, but when you want to deduct points,
you must use Markdown lists with the following format:

* (-3) This deducts 3 points.
* (-2) This deducts 2 points.
* (1) This _should_ add 1 point.

^--- If you run the `feedback` command with a `max_points` argument set to `30`,
the final score for this lab should be `26`. (((30 - 3) - 2) + 1)
